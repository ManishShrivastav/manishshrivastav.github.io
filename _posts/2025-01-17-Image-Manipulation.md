In this project, I performed various image processing tasks on an image of a Camaro, focusing on basic image manipulations like cropping, flipping, and color channel separation. The goal was to explore how image data can be accessed and manipulated, as well as gain experience in creating new images by combining different color channels and performing transformations.

## The Questions

1. How can we manipulate an image by cropping it to specific regions?
2. How can we flip an image vertically and horizontally?
3. How can we isolate and manipulate the individual color channels (red, green, and blue) of an image?
4. What happens when we combine or stack individual color channels back together?

## Tools I Used

- **Python Libraries:**
  - **`scikit-image`**: For loading and saving the image files.
  - **`NumPy`**: To create arrays and manipulate pixel data.
  - **`matplotlib`**: For displaying images and visualizing results.

- **Image Data**: The Camaro image used in this project.

## The Analysis

1. **Cropping**: The image was cropped into multiple sections to focus on different areas. Using array slicing, I extracted specific parts of the image based on pixel coordinates.
   
   Example code for cropping:
   ```python
   # Cropping the image
   cropped = camaro[0:500,:,:]
   plt.imshow(cropped)
   plt.show()
   ```

2. **Flipping**: The image was flipped both vertically and horizontally. This allowed me to explore how images can be mirrored along different axes using NumPy array slicing techniques.

Example code for vertical flip:
```python
vertical_flip = camaro[::-1, :, :]
plt.imshow(vertical_flip)
plt.show()
```

Example code for horizontal flip:
```python
horizontal_flip = camaro[:, ::-1, :]
plt.imshow(horizontal_flip)
plt.show()
```
3. **Color Channel Isolation**: The Camaro image was split into three separate color channels (red, green, and blue). By creating empty arrays and inserting only one color channel into each, I was able to isolate each color and display them individually. This also included stacking and arranging the color channels to observe how the image appears when only one color is visible at a time.

Example code for isolating the red channel:
```python
red = np.zeros(camaro.shape, dtype='uint8')
red[:, :, 0] = camaro[:, :, 0]
plt.imshow(red)
plt.show()
```

4. **Combining Channels**: The three color channels were combined both vertically, horizontally and back into single image to create new images, exploring how different channel arrangements affect the visual representation.

Example code for stacking channels vertically:
```python
camaro_rainbow = np.vstack((red, green, blue))
plt.imshow(camaro_rainbow)
plt.show()
```
Example code for recombining channels into single image:

```python
camaro_rainbow_d = np.dstack((red[:, :, 0], green[:, :, 1], blue[:, :, 2]))
plt.imshow(camaro_rainbow_d)
plt.show()
```

## The Result
* The project produced several modified versions of the original Camaro image, including:

  * Cropped sections of the image, focusing on different regions.
  * Vertically and horizontally flipped versions.
  * Separate visualizations of the red, green, and blue channels.
  * Stacked and arranged versions of the image using different color channels.
* The final output included images with specific channel isolations and flipped versions saved as separate files.

## What I Learned

* **Image Representation**: I learned that images are represented as multi-dimensional arrays, where each pixel is defined by values across multiple color channels (RGB).
* **Array Manipulations**: Using NumPy, I gained experience with array slicing, which is essential for cropping, isolating color channels, and flipping images.
* **Image Processing Techniques**: The project allowed me to experiment with various image manipulations, such as flipping, cropping, and isolating color channels, which are fundamental operations in many image processing tasks.
* **Visualizing Data**: I became proficient in using matplotlib to display images, which is crucial for visualizing and interpreting the results of image processing.


## Challenges Faced
* **Understanding Image Data Structure**: Initially, understanding how the image data is structured and how to manipulate it was a bit challenging. The image is essentially a 3D array (height, width, channels), and knowing how to correctly index and modify these dimensions took some time to grasp.
* **Array Indexing**: Working with NumPy array slicing required careful attention to the dimensions and the correct use of indices, especially when cropping or isolating color channels.
* **Ensuring Correct Aspect Ratios**: While stacking or concatenating images, I needed to ensure that the dimensions of the arrays matched, especially when combining color channels to avoid distorted visualizations.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable experience in working with image data and performing basic image processing tasks using Python. Through cropping, flipping, and isolating color channels, 
I learned how to manipulate images at the pixel level. It also gave me a better understanding of how images are represented in memory and how to work with these representations using tools like NumPy and scikit-image.
This project helped solidify my skills in basic image manipulation, which will be useful in more advanced image processing and computer vision tasks.
